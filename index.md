## Day 1, morning (Arrival before 12:45)

### Out metro entrance **A** (not B)

### Towards the "main building" ("undergraduate center")

### Continue down the street past the main entrance
The main entrance can also get you there (and has an info desk to help you), but walking outside is probably nice.

### In the back entrance

It is entrance "M" (no one would call it this, though).

### TODO: walk straight in, towards the further corridor

### Down corridor
To the left (south).

### Take the stairs next to the cafe
Take the **stairs** up if possible.  Go to the 5th floor.  Knock on the locked door or call us and we will let you in.  The elevator needs a keycard, call us if you need it or maybe someone can help you.  Say you are going to the "Top Lounge".

The cafe is closed since forever, but is a good landmark.

### TODO: The "Top lounge" is right on the left.

Our room is behind the double glass doors labeled "Top Lounge".

## Day 1, main meeting rooms and lunch (arrival after 13:00)

### Leave the metro station (exit **A**, not B) as before

### Head towards the left (west)

### Head down between the buildings (west)

### Main room and lunch are across the street from each other
For the main rooms, there will be signs in the building or ask the reception.  It is right in the lobby.

For lunch, it is the restarunt "Arvo".  Registered participants have their lunches paid by Nordic-RSE, but you'll need to find us to manage this.  Call the phone number you have been given.
